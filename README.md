CODA Knowledge Graph
--------------------
The CODA Knowledge Graph integrates multiple data sources to create a comprehensive
medical knowledge base. The following table summarizes the content and structure
contributed by each source:

Running CODA using Docker
-------------------------

### Running without cloning the repository

If you have Docker installed, you can run CODA without cloning the repository.
Download the Docker Compose file and the example environment file, then configure
your settings:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codaproject/coda/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codaproject/coda/main/.env.example
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your OPENAI_API_KEY
docker-compose up
```

This pulls pre-built images from Docker Hub and starts all services.

### Running with Docker compose

The easiest way to run CODA is with Docker compose, which starts all services:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

optionally with --build as an additional argument to build the images locally.

This starts three services:
- **kg** (`coda.kg`) - Neo4j knowledge graph on ports 7474 (browser) and 7687 (bolt)
- **inference** (`coda.inference`) - Inference agent on port 5123
- **app** (`coda.app`) - Web application on port 8000

Access the web UI at http://localhost:8000 and Neo4j browser at http://localhost:7474.

### Building and running the knowledge graph only

To build and run just the CODA knowledge graph:

```bash
docker build --tag coda.kg:latest -f Dockerfile.kg .
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7474:7474 coda.kg:latest
```

Running CODA locally with Python
---------------------------------

After installing the package, you can run CODA locally. Make sure your
`OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set.

The quickest way is to use the startup script, which launches both the inference
agent and web application and reports when the system is ready:

```bash
./startup.sh
```

Alternatively, you can start the services individually. Start the inference agent:

```bash
python -m coda.inference.agent
```

This runs the inference server on port 5123. You can specify the LLM provider
and model:

```bash
python -m coda.inference.agent --provider openai --model gpt-5.4-mini
```

Then, in a separate terminal, start the web application:

```bash
python -m coda.app
```

The web UI will be available at http://localhost:8000.
